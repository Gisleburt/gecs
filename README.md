GECs - Gisleburt's Electronic Components
========================================

A collection of libraries that can be used for powering electronic components using [embedded-hal] interfaces.

ToDo:
-----

- [ ] Come up with a better name / is this name ok?
- [ ] Think about how to make a common interface for things like displays. Current 8 segment interface doesn't
      work for things that need to be switched, eg a 4 digit 8 segment display.
- [ ] One project with features or multiple features?
